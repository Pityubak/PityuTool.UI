# PityuTool.UI
Component for borderless windows forms

### Overview

1. Drag/move by name or type
2. Resizing
3. Rounded form
3. Custom border
4. Custom shadow

#### Limitations 
Previous version make controls transparent by mouse, but this use another approach, this is the reason for the resizing limitations:
just pure form is resizeable.
Drawing of the shadow is not perfect, and in my opinion the rounded shape is ugly.

#### Dependencies
.NET Framework 3.5+
